# screp-js

A pure Javascript version of [screp](https://github.com/icza/screp), a StarCraft: Remastered replay file parser, compiled from the original Go version using [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

screp (StarCraft: Brood War Replay Parser) is a library for extracting information from StarCraft replay files. This library is based on a recompiled version of that library for Javascript. It's designed to parse file buffers of .rep filesâ€”if you want an easier interface aimed at parsing files through Node, try [screp-js-file](https://github.com/msikma/screp-js-file).

This wrapper is usable both as a CommonJS module and as a browser global.

## Installation

This library can be installed through npm:

```
npm i --save screp-js
```

This library is about 367 KB gzipped (and 1,3 MB otherwise), as the compiled code generated by GopherJS is quite large.

## Usage

The screp library can be either included in an HTML page, in which case it will be added to the global namespace as `Screp`, or it can be imported as a CommonJS module:

```js
const Screp = require('screp-js')

const processRep(uint8arr) {
  try {
    // 'uint8arr' is a Uint8Array containing a .rep file.
    const res = await Screp.parseBuffer(uint8arr)
    return res
  }
  catch (err) {
    // If something went wrong, 'err' will be an Error object containing a string thrown by Go.
    console.log(err)
  }
}
```

### Reference

**Function:**

```js
Screp.parseBuffer(uint8arr[, {options}])
```

**Parameters:**

* `uint8arr` **Uint8Array**\
  the command to parse
* `options` **object** (optional)\
  a set of options used to change parsing behavior:
  * `header` **boolean**: *true*\
    include replay header
  * `computed` **boolean**: *true*\
    print computed/derived data
  * `mapData` **boolean**: *false*\
    include map data
  * `mapTiles` **boolean**: *false*\
    include map tiles; valid with `mapData`
  * `mapResLoc` **boolean**: *false*\
    print map data resource locations (minerals and geysers); valid with `mapData`
  * `cmds` **boolean**: *false*\
    print player commands

**Returns:**
